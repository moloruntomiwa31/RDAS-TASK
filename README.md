# RDAS TASK
This is a task for my technical assement test on Vue3 for RDAS Nigeria.
I was to create a form that takes input from the user then add the user's data to a table on the same page.
Also, i was to build display pages for students and items that share a unique component for displaying the table.

During the course of building, I worked with Vue Router for Routing, Pinia for State Management. I made use of Vue 3 composition api and used correct implementation of props, emit events and reactivity. My components were also will structured with this defined principles. I also used TailwindCSS as my preferred CSS Framework with plain css.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
